7.6)
val x = ref 0;
fun p(y' : int ref) = (
  val memory_location = y'
  val rvalue = !y'

  y' = 1
  x = 0

  memory_location = !y'
);
p(x);

7.7a) The procedure pass() is given the values 1 and 1. x is set to 1+1=2, y is set to 2+1=3, then x is set to 3. i, whose value was set outside of the prodecure, is set to 1+1=2. When we leave the prodecure, i is printed as 1.

b) The same process that happens for part (a) will occur, but since the references to i's location in memory were passed, i can actually be modified inside the function. In the end, i will be printed as 2.

c) The values 1 and 1 are passed to the function. x is set to 1+1=2, y is set to 2+1=3, then x is set to 3. i is set to 1+1=2. Upon returning from the function, the values of x and y (which were alaises for i) are filled in for i outside the function. When i is printed, 3 is displayed.

7.8a) In static scope, a global identifier refers to the identifier with that name that is declared in the closest enclosing scope.
Line 2: x=2, from line 1
Line 4: x=7, from line 3
Line 5: x=7, again from line 3
x+f(x) = 7 + f(7) = 7 + (7 + 2) = 16

b) In dynamic scope, a global identifier refers to the identifier associated with the most recent activation record.
Line 2: x=2, from line 1
Line 4: x=7, frome line 3
Line 5: x=7, again frome line 3
x+f(x) = 7 + f(7) = 7 + (7 + 7) = 21
